INTRODUCTION​

This report analyzes the academic performance of secondary school students in mathematics. The goal is to identify factors affecting student performance and provide data-driven recommendations for improving success rates.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The academic performance of secondary school students in mathematics varies due to multiple factors, including parental education, internet access, family and school support, study habits, and gender. However, the extent of these influences is not well understood.​

This analysis seeks to identify the key factors affecting student success or failure in mathematics and provide data-driven insights to improve student outcomes.​

​

Key Questions:​

How does parental education impact student performance?​

Does internet access influence academic success?​

What role do family and school support programs play in reducing failure rates?​

How do study habits and study time affect performance?​

Are there gender disparities in student performance?​

​

Objective:​

To provide actionable recommendations that educators, parents, and policymakers can use to enhance student learning experiences and reduce failure rates in mathematics.

METHPODLOGY
To analyze the factors affecting student performance in mathematics, the following methodology was used:​

1. Data Collection​

The dataset consists of secondary school students’ academic records, including:​
Parental education levels​

Internet access availability​

Family and school support programs​

Study time and habits​

Gender distribution​

Student failure rates in mathematics​
The data was sourced from school records, surveys, and academic performance reports

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing​

Missing values were identified and handled appropriately.​

Data types were standardized for numerical and categorical variables.​
Outliers were examined to ensure data integrity.

Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)​

Descriptive Statistics: Used to summarize student performance trends.​

Bar Charts: To compare average student scores by parental education.​

Failure Rate Analysis: Comparing students based on gender, internet access, and support programs.​

. Interpretation of Insights​

Trends were analyzed to determine which factors had the strongest impact on student success.​

Comparisons were made between students with different levels of support and resources.​

Insights were extracted to guide recommendations.​

5. Recommendations & Action Plan​

Based on the findings, strategic recommendations were proposed to improve student outcomes.​

The recommendations focus on parental involvement, internet accessibility, school support, and effective study habits.
